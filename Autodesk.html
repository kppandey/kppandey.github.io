									<h2>Autodesk</h2>
									<h4>Improving Design Platforms</h4>
									<p>As a UI Developer, I worked with the HCI & Vis research team to develop an advanced React app prototype for Autodesk 3D modeling softwares.</p>
									<hr />
									<h4>About HCI & VIS Research Team</h4>
									<p>A team of expert scientists with a goal to explore and create technologies to improve design through high-level projects and collaboration with leading research universities.
										Curious about Autodesk Research? <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/research/projects">Find more projects here!</a>
									</p>
									
									<h4>Problem</h4>
									<p>At Autodesk, we noticed <strong>two main problems</strong> of our design platforms:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Loss of knowledge that occurs when iterating designs.</li>
										<li>There is no seamless communication tool for collaboration.</li>
									</ol>

									<h4> Design Process</h4>
									<p> The main problem I was trying to solve was: <strong>How can we incorporate communication and capture knowledge in design platforms to improve the entire design experience? </strong></p>
									<p>I first conducted research to better understand Autodesk users. I read through existing documents in Autodesk's help desk, Slack channels and interviewed developers of the softwares.</p>
									<h4>Pain Points</h4>
												<ol>
													<li>Users cannot track their design and see their previous edits when iterating.</li>
													<li>Collaboration is inconvenient.</li>
													<li>Users cannot communicate with collaborators during design progress.</li>
												</ol>
									<h4>Solution</h4>
									<p>Due to the short timeframe I had, I decided to focus on one solution: <strong>to allow users to communicate with other collaborators and track their progress as they design.</strong></p>
									<h4>Design Iterations</h4>
									<ol>
										<li>Review competitors features and other similar UI patterns.</li>
										<li>Study existing designs in the Autodesk system to have more context on prior visual style decisions.</li>
										<li>Draw low-fidelity mockups for a general outline on how to organize the information and tools.</li>
										<li>Create high-fidelity solutions and collaborate with other computer scientists and engineers for internal iterations.</li>
									
									</ol>
									<h4>Challenges</h4>
									<p><strong>Determining how to incorporate communication in these softwares.</strong> <br>Since the goal of this prototype was to allow users to collaborate with their colleagues and track their design iterations, I decided that the best solution would be to use Slack API.
										I created an add-in application that will allow users to connect their designs to Slack within Autodesk softwares.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Deciding on the simplest experience for the user to connect to Slack through the Autodesk software.</strong><br> 
										After conducting A/B testing, I found that the easist solution was to immediately connect to Slack after the user creates a new design.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Technical Challenges.</strong> <br> For this project, I had to not only design the prototype but I had to develop it as well. 
									It was quite a challenge but learning React was one of my key highlights for this internship. Additionally, I was able to gain a lot of knowledge in backend development. I had to understand how to deploy a React app on AWS, Docker and Jenkins.</p>
