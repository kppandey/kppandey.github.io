									<h4>Building a Design System For Dead Space</h4>
									<p>In Fall 2021, I completed an internship of a lifetime (as a Sims fan) - I was given a chance to work at EA. I worked at Motive Montreal studio with the Experience Design team on the Dead Space remake.    </p>
									<hr />
									<!-- 
									<h4>Hi there! This case study is still a work in progress.</h4>
									<p>Please come back in a few days, or if you would like, feel free to contact me via <a href="mailto:kumudikapan@gmail.com">email</a> or message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kumudikapandey/">LinkedIn</a>.
										<a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/motive/news/getting-into-the-games-industry">Here is an interview</a> I did during my time at EA! 
									</p>
									-->
									<h4>Dead Space Remake</h4>
									<p>Motive EA is building the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dead-space">remake of the first Dead Space video game</a> focusing on three key features:
										<ol>
											<li><strong>Action Gameplay:</strong> Improve combat to give more agency to the player and add more gameplay options.</li>
											<li><strong>Tension and Suspense:</strong> More unpredictable moments, danger, gore.</li>
											<li><strong>Unbroken Immersion:</strong> Ensure that nothing will break the player's immersion in the world of Dead Space.</li>
										</ol>
									</p>
									<h4>About Experience Design Team (XD)</h4>
									<p>The team consisted of UX designers, UI artists, and UI engineers. 
										I began my internship learning from all three aspects of Experience Design in Games: I created UX wireframes, designed UI components and art, and learned how to implement the UI assets to the Frostbite Engine. 
									</p>
									<h4>Problem | Pain Points of XD</h4>
										<ol>
											<li><strong>Organization:</strong> No access to common design elements in a library.</li>
											<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> No efficient collaboration amongst the team.</li>
											<li><strong>Velocity:</strong> Slow workflow and process, the team is unable to build projects faster.</li>
											<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Challenging to maintain the same language, theme, style guide throughout the game.</li>
										</ol>
									<h4>Solution</h4>
									<p>After interviewing with other EA studios and XD teams, we found that design systems provide a convenient way to display a collection of our game assets and components needed to build UI features. 
										Majority of our UI features have reusable UI elements, thus by having access to these reusable elements in a design system, it will <strong>result in a more efficient workflow for the team.</strong>
									</p>
									<h4>Design Process</h4>
									<p>I had to learn the ins and outs of Design Systems so first, I reviewed many popular design systems including Material Design System, Apple HI Guidelines, and Atlassian Design System.
										Since their system centers on providing assistance to improve productivity and workflow of teams globablly, I found <strong>Atlassian Design System </strong>to be the most helpful in applying a system to our XD team. 
										<br>
										To establish rules and principles for the Design System, I found applying the <a href="https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/">Atomic Design Methodology</a>  simplified my process. 
										<strong>The Atomic Design</strong> is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner. 
										For our Design System, I chose to break down the UI features using the first three stages: <strong>Atoms, Molecules, Organisms</strong>.
									</p>
									<h4>Building the Design System</h4>
									<ol>
										<li>Defined and prioritized UI features to include in the system.</li>
										<li>Created a catalogue of all reusable components in our game: patterns, colours, text styles, icons, UI art.</li>
										<li>Determined atoms and molecules of each UI feature.</li>
										<li>Developed standards and documentation for reusable elements.</li>
										<li>Organized game assets and components in Frostbite Engine.</li>
									</ol>
									<h4>Challenges</h4>
									<p><strong>Designing for multiple disciplinaries.</strong> <br>Since this Design System will be used by UX designers, UI artists, UI engineers, and QA analysts, I found it challenging to ensure that it is understandable and accessible to everyone.
										I learned that feedback from design iterations is crucial to make sure I am structuring the documentations well enough for anyone to follow.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Restructuring the workflow.</strong> <br>The team was very open to any suggestions and changes I made, however it was challenging at first to open their eyes to new practices.
										I had to establish guiding design principles and show the value of having a Design System for the team.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Importance of having a Design System.</strong> <br> Although I have used Design Systems in the past at Autodesk and Apple, I began realizing the significance of it during my time at EA.
										As a designer, I appreciate design systems more now that I have learned how they bring order to chaos. I look forward to working on more design systems in the future!
