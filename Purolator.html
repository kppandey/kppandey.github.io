									<h4>Route Optimization</h4>
									<p>I developed and led a project to develop an application to automate and simplify route planning.</p>
									<hr />
									<h4>About Purolator</h4>
									<p>Purolator is one of the oldest courier companies in Canada. It is a leading freight, package and logistics provider.
										As it's considered a local Canadian company, they have been fortunate to have long-term employees which has contributed to their success in the freight industry. 
										When I joined the Operations team, they had just began strategizing on <Strong>how to retain tribal knowledge</Strong>.
										To learn more about the benefits of this project, <a href="https://www.purolatorinternational.com/how-to-cut-costs-in-your-supply-chain-with-effective-routing/">read here!</a>
									
									</p>
									
									<h4>Problem</h4>
									<p>There were two problems that we wanted to prioritize:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>The reliance of tribal knowledge across the warehouses.</li>
										<li>Manual delivery and pick-up routes planning.</li>
									</ol>

									<h4> Design Process</h4>
									<p> The main problem I was trying to solve was: <strong>How can we automate route planning and make it more efficient? </strong></p>
									<p>In order to develop an application for route planning, I needed to understand how route managers created routes in the first place. 
										I conducted various usability testing and personas to better understand the "users" or in this case, the route managers for this product. 
										I also shadowed and interviewed route managers to determine what decisions they use to create routes in order to understand their thought process. 
									</p>
									<!--
									<h4>Pain Points / ROUGH</h4>
												<ol>
													<li>Users cannot track their design and see their previous edits when iterating.</li>
													<li>Collaboration is inconvenient.</li>
													<li>Users cannot communicate with collaborators during design progress.</li>
												</ol>
									<h4>Solution / ROUGH</h4>
									<p>Due to the short timeframe I had, I decided to focus on one solution: <strong>to allow users to communicate with other collaborators and track their progress as they design.</strong></p>
									-->
									<h4>Design Iterations</h4>
									<ol>
										<li><strong>Research other freight companies and their route planning solutions: </strong>I met with Canada Post and UPS to better understand how their companies have automated route planning</li>
										<li>Strategizing with the higher-ups, to determine the cheapest, less costly application that we can build to automate route planning.</li>
										<li>Create low-fidelity mockups to understand the outline of each interface that we wanted to develop. </li>
										<li>Designed high-fidelity mockups and collaborated both with the engineering team and well as the fields team including route managers to determine the best designs.</li>
									
									</ol>
									<h4>Challenges</h4>
									<p><strong>Constant feedback is very important.</strong> <br> I learned that whether it's from the engineering team or the field, feedback is crucial when designing and developing a product.
										Additionally, I learned that you should always go back to the "Why" of the project. 
										Whenever I had difficulty with a design decision, I learned to ask myself does this decision help in the problem we're trying to solve? <i>Would this decision make route planning efficient and usable for route managers + less costly?</i>
									</p>
